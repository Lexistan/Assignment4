      <h2>Growing up in Church</h2>

     <p> I grew up in an extremely religious family, very old school and conservative. Suffice to say, I was only exposed to church music and old hymns for the first period of my life. I really didn't know any different.</p>
 
      <h2>Getting my Eyes Opened</h2>
      <img src="images/spice.jpg" alt=Spice_Girls width="500" height="350" title="I'll tell ya what I want, what I really really want">
      <p>My mother who was a little more worldly than her parents, once played Spice Girls on the radio, and I had never heard anything like it. I remember vividly thinking that every female singer on the radio was a Spice Girl. It’s really funny and embarrassing in retrospect.</p>
     
      <h2>Heaven is a Halfpipe</h2>
      <img src="images/chino.jpg" alt=Deftones width="500" height="350" title="Deftones at the Pageant, the first real concert I went to">
            <p>Then I started playing videogames and the soundtracks to Tony Hawk Pro Skater and Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX changed my world. I got exposed to punk, and nu-metal like Dead Kennedys, Dropkick Murphys, and Deftones. Deftones was my favorite band for a long time. </p>
         
      <h2>School Daze</h2>
      <img src="images/kris and greandpa.jpg" alt=Kris_and_grandpa width="500" height="350" title="Good old days">
      <p>My mother moved me to University City when i was 15, and I became exposed to secular music in a big way. This was around the time of Emo bands. I learned how to play Something Corporate on piano, and Bright Eyes compelled me to buy a guitar and learn to play it. I also frequented Streetside Records and Vintage Vinyl in the Delmar Loop.</p>
      
        <h2>The Local Scene</h2>
        <img src="images/berlin whale.jpg" alt=Berlin_whale width="500" height="350" title="I've got lots in common with watches and clocks">
      <p>This period transitioned into me performing in bands across St. Louis. I played at Creepy Crawl and Mississippi Nights with my bands Half Past Nine, Hazel Would, and Berlin Whale.       
            My bands fell apart, as all bands do, and I unintentionally joined the rave scene. This was during my Meramec Community College days. </p> 
            
        <h2> The Big Easy</h2>
        <img src="images/charmane.jpg" alt=Charmaine width="500" height="350" title="Snug Harbor with Charmane Neville"><img src="images/KrisandCharmane.jpg" alt=Charmaine width="500" height="350" title="Close up with a close friend">
      <p>Shortly after this, I moved to New Orleans, a live music hub. I never played in a band there, but I was always close to a live music venue, and I had plenty of musician friends. Julie Odell was one of my favorite singers. Charmaine Neville, the niece of Aaron Neville, was a close friend of mine too. </p>
      
      
        <h2> Full Circle</h2>
        <img src="images/toro.jpg" alt=toro_y_moi width="500" height="350" title="Causers of This" >
      <p>I moved away and my taste changed again. I started listening to genres like shoegaze and dreampop. One of my closest moments with my brother was when we sat on the roof of the house where we grew up and listened to Toro Y Moi’s “Imprint After.” It’s still one of my favorite songs. You know how you might not have gotten along with your siblings when you were little, but when you got older, you changed that? That's what that song represents to me. </p>

      <h2>A Lagniappe</h2>
        <test p class= "funParagraph">There's so much more I think about, like how thankful I am to exist at the same time of Flying Lotus and Thundercat, or how I'd marry Diana Krall if she ever left Elvis Costello. I think about how my taste has been shaped and sculpted by geographical location and the weirder friends I've had. It's so important to me to have met the people I have, and to have gone to where I've been. I appreciate you reading all this.<br>

            Um, you know who I haven't listened to in years? 50&#162;
